# Minecraft-Modpack-Installer
A simple Minecraft mod pack installer for macOS, that I wrote in BASH, Pashua and CocoaDialogue when I was 15. Demonstrates file downloading, GUIs, and archive/file manipulation.

For convenience, I have included all of the files that can possibly be downloaded in this repository.
However, the program downloads what ever files are necessary from my dropbox drive.

In order to use this program, you need only download one zip containing the program (sending macOS programs outside of an archive is not possible, since they are essentially just directories).

In order to read the code, go to Otuku Mod Installer/Contents/Resources/script

(I would like to emphasise that I wrote this when I was 15)
