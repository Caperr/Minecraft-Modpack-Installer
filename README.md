# Minecraft-Modpack-Installer
A simple Minecraft mod pack installer for macOS, that I wrote in BASH, Pashua and CocoaDialogue when I was 15. Demonstrates file downloading, GUIs, and archive/file manipulation.

The program downloads what ever files are necessary from my dropbox drive: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nry3fqc90ip2riw/AADzIlmHkEppu_8o5TcI9EX2a?dl=0

In order to use this program, download the latest zip from the releases section.

(I would like to emphasise that I wrote this when I was 15)
